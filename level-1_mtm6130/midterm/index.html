            And no, my last name isn't actually Bells. That's just a nickname my uncle gave me. I am a dachshund-pinscher mix but humans tend to mistake me for just a weenie dog with floppy ears. I cry a lot. Like a whole lot. Dad falls for it which is great, so I can get all the chicken I want. Yea. I really <span style="font-weight:bold">love</span> chicken. Mom once said my butt was going to grow wings from all the chicken I eat but nothing's happened yet. I'm still waiting. I chased a bird once. My sister tried catching me but I ran as fast as I could and when I was cornered, I swallowed the bird whole. It was great! Ever since that, she called me "bird-eater." Nowadays, I can't really run anymore. I'm 10 years old now and I'm a lot heavier than I've ever been. I just can't stop eating chicken! And I can't stop asking for more. Did I mention I really <span style="font-weight:bold">love</span> chicken? I can't stop thinking about it. I also like to watch TV with my dad on the couch. I love the couch, it's so soft and perfect for me. I once pushed my sister off the couch so a stranger could pet me a lot. Mom doesn't like it though, says I leave all my hair all over it. I think everyone but dad is allergic to me, but I don't really mind. Dad is my favourite human. Please pet me? I really like pets and belly rubs. I promise I won't bite. Not that I do anyway. I'm too lazy to actually get mad at you, so I make a terrible guard dog. I only bark when I'm begging dad for food, which is every dinner and second dinner. I'm so happy dad is always home now, so I get to take naps with him all day and sleep beside him every night. I like to sleep a lot. It's my favourite hobby next to eating. Mom scares me and I don't like my sisters especially when they give me baths. Baths are scary. Send me pets ok?
